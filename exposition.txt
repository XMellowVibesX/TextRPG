[Katherine] The villagers of Rensa'ri have
requested the aid of the Adventurer's
Guild to eliminate a goblin camp just
south of the village.

[Katherine] They are paying a decent 
amount of gold for it. Rest assured, 
you'll be fairly compensated.

[Katherine] You'll take it? Great!
I wish you the best of luck.

[Katherine] Ad astra abyssosque!
